Tutorial description: Let's build an Instagram clone using Ruby on Rails 5. We'll use rapid web development to get an MVP setup fast! This web app tutorial will cover the sign up / sign in / edit account using the devise gem. We'll also add ability to upload photos to Amazon AWS S3 using the carrierwave gem and build a profile page and feed of latest posts.
